    <h1>I love potatoes</h1>
    <p>My garbage website... Hi, My names vote4pedro273. And in case you couldn't tell, I love potatoes. This is my website that contains information about me and my "programs" that I have developed. I'm still learning javascript and my brain is microscopic I may never truly learn it. My first and only website that I have developed as of the creation of this README is a <a href="/cow">random cow meme generator</a> that I made with the help of my friend " <a href="https://github.com/Awashcard0/">Awashcard0</a>". Who unlike me, has a brain that is visible to the human eye (It's actually becoming quite serious it's started to seep out of his ears and being in a room with him is very uncomfortable as he is very self concious about it and if you stare at it too long his temper seeps out just like the gross brain goo puss stuff does out of his ears, I have several bruises on my back to prove it). Well, I hope you enjoy my website, and if your interested in knowing, I'm attracted to geese. </p>
